# âœ¨ Python Decorators and Closures Tutorial Module ðŸ“š

This module serves as a tutorial on closures and decorators in Python. It introduces the fundamental concepts of closures and decorators and explains their usage and benefits in Python programming.

## ðŸ“œ Code Snippet

```python
class DecoratorsTutorial:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        This function introduces the concept of closures and decorators in Python.
        """
        print("In Python, closures are a result of variable scope and first-class functions. "
              "They allow functions to have access to an outer function's scope, even after the outer function has returned.")
        print("A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its functionality without explicitly modifying it. "
              "In essence, decorators provide a way to modify functions using other functions. This is ideal when you need to extend "
              "the functionality of functions that you don't want to modify.")

    def decorators_example(self):
        """
        This function demonstrates the creation and use of a decorator in Python.
        """
        print("\nExample of a decorator in Python:")

        def my_decorator(func):
            def wrapper():
                print("Before the function call")
                func()
                print("After the function call")
            return wrapper

        @my_decorator
        def say_hello():
            print("Hello, world!")

        say_hello()

    def closure_example(self):
        """
        This function demonstrates the creation and use of a closure in Python.
        """
        print("\nExample of a closure in Python:")

        def outer_function(msg):
            def inner_function():
                print(msg)
            return inner_function

        hi_func = outer_function("Hi")
        bye_func = outer_function("Bye")

        hi_func()
        bye_func()

    def exercise(self):
        """
        Exercise: Define a decorator named 'timer'. This decorator should time how long the execution of the decorated function takes.
        """
        print("\nExercise: Check the docstring for the exercise. Try to solve it!")

    def quiz(self):
        """
        Quiz: What is a closure? What is a decorator? How do you apply a decorator to a function?
        """
        print("\nQuiz: Check the docstring for the quiz. Try to answer it!")

tutorial = DecoratorsTutorial()
tutorial.decorators_example()
tutorial.closure_example()
tutorial.exercise()
tutorial.quiz()
```

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

The code snippet introduces a `DecoratorsTutorial` class that provides explanations, examples, exercises, and quizzes related to closures and decorators in Python. It explains the concept of closures, which allow functions to access variables from their enclosing scope, even after the outer function has returned.

The tutorial also covers decorators, which are functions that enhance the functionality of other functions without directly modifying them. Decorators provide a flexible way to add functionality to existing functions, making them more versatile and reusable.

The `decorators_example` method demonstrates the creation and use of a decorator. It defines a decorator called `my_decorator`, which wraps a function with additional functionality. The `say_hello` function is decorated with `my_decorator`, showcasing how the decorator modifies the behavior of the function.

The `closure_example` method showcases the creation and use of a closure. It defines an `outer_function` that returns an `inner_function`. The `inner_function` has access to the `msg` variable from the enclosing scope of `outer_function`, demonstrating how closures retain access to variables even after the outer function has finished execution.

The `exercise` method presents an exercise for the reader to solve

. It asks to define a decorator named `timer` that measures the execution time of the decorated function.

The `quiz` method poses a quiz to test the reader's understanding of closures and decorators in Python.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with the tutorial, simply create an instance of the `DecoratorsTutorial` class and call its methods to explore the explanations, examples, exercises, and quizzes provided.

Feel free to modify the code, add more examples or exercises, or customize the content to suit your learning needs. Enjoy learning about closures and decorators in Python! ðŸŽ‰
